- Render the layout natively in a custom card. No picture-elements export: it cannot do motion fade, door geometry highlights or per-type behaviour without YAML per element.
- Popups are HA's more-info dialogs. Custom dialogs only for confirmed actions (open a door).
- Two repos. This one is public with a demo layout. The maintainer's house stays in a private repo that consumes this library.
- Stack: TypeScript and Lit for editor and card, core in TypeScript without a framework, Vite build, Vitest tests. Vanilla was considered and rejected: a card and a panel by hand means manual re-render on every `hass` update and no types on a growing schema.
- A small integration ships with the package for load and save over websocket, so the editor and card share one stored layout. File drop into `www/` remains a fallback.
- Name `ha-floorplan-studio`, licence MIT. `ha-floorplan` is taken by another project.
- Icons: Material Design Icons (Apache 2.0), the set HA uses, inlined as paths.
- A prompt for LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) produces the first layout from photos. It lives in `prompts/` and the README explains the steps.
