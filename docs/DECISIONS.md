# Decisions

Newest first. A change supersedes; nothing is edited.

## 2026-09-19 Geometry port (S1.3)

- `movePoints` takes an optional fifth argument `only: { poly, i }` naming the point to move when `detach` is true. Without it, detach moves the first match. A pure function cannot know which of several coincident points the user grabbed.
- `mergeCorners` ports the clustering and de-duplication of `simplify.py`. It does not pull corners onto edges or re-seat doors; the editor does that when a point is dropped (`stitch`).

## 2026-09-19 Untrusted JSON is typed `any` at the boundary

- ESLint `no-explicit-any` is off. `validate` and `migrate` read files nobody typed; they inspect them as `any` and return the typed `Layout`.
- `validate` requires every object to have an `id` (the spec says so) and reports all errors, not the first.

## 2026-09-19 Founding decisions

- Render the layout natively in a custom card. No picture-elements export: it cannot do motion fade, door geometry highlights or per-type behaviour without YAML per element.
- Popups are HA's more-info dialogs. Custom dialogs only for confirmed actions (open a door).
- Two repos. This one is public with a demo layout. The maintainer's house stays in a private repo that consumes this library.
- Stack: TypeScript and Lit for editor and card, core in TypeScript without a framework, Vite build, Vitest tests. Vanilla was considered and rejected: a card and a panel by hand means manual re-render on every `hass` update and no types on a growing schema.
- A small integration ships with the package for load and save over websocket, so the editor and card share one stored layout. File drop into `www/` remains a fallback.
- Name `ha-floorplan-studio`, licence MIT. `ha-floorplan` is taken by another project.
- Icons: Material Design Icons (Apache 2.0), the set HA uses, inlined as paths.
- A prompt for LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) produces the first layout from photos. It lives in `prompts/` and the README explains the steps.
