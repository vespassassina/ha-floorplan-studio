# Decisions

Newest first. A change supersedes; nothing is edited.

## 2026-09-19 Drawing before the card; organising the home is a goal

- Sprint 1.5 (zones, water, wall kinds, floors, draw mode, Device menu) runs before the card. Each changes what `renderFloor` draws; done first, the card gets them with no rework. Schema stays version 2: only added enum values and optional fields, so `migrate` needs no new rule.
- "Zone" is the schema name for a dotted subdivision inside a room (`room.kind: "zone"`, `w` all false). Not "area": `room.area` already means the HA area id, and a room and a zone both map to one.
- `wall.kind` keeps `wall` and `boundary` (their meaning is unchanged) and gains `external`, `fence`, `edge`. No migration.
- The non-goal "editing HA areas, devices or entities" is dropped. Epic E6 (Sprint 4) creates areas, moves devices into them, makes helpers, groups and automations from the plan. It runs only in the HA panel, after the integration (Sprint 3), because every step needs `hass` and the registry websocket commands. Prompt and docs move to Sprint 5.
- Every HA write is confirmed in a dialog, labelled `floorplan-studio` (HA label, created once) so the user can find and remove what the tool made, and never triggered by load or save. HA registries have no undo; the dialog says so.
- One switch to one light is the Switch-as-X helper plus `bound`, not an automation. Automations are for many-to-one, group-to-group and schedules.
- An automation is created through `POST config/automation/config/<id>` and then HA's own editor is opened on it. Prefilling HA's editor without saving first is not possible from a custom panel (the initial data lives in a module variable of the frontend), and `history.state` hacks break across releases. Create, then open.
- The panel uses HA's own elements (`ha-area-picker`, `ha-entity-picker`, `ha-textfield`, `mwc-button`) and maps `--fp-*` to HA theme variables. The standalone build keeps plain controls behind the same panel code.

## 2026-09-19 Review fixes for S1.7 (Opus review)

- Openings, extras and stairs edges are drawn by `renderFloor`, not by the editor overlay, so the card (S2.1) gets them for free. Paint order: rooms, stairs, outlines, walls, stairs edges, openings, extras, furniture, doors, devices, room names. The editor keeps only handles. Extra names are escaped. Snapshot changed by the four stairs edge lines only (the demo has no openings or extras).
- `save-request` keeps the Layout as `detail`. The element gains `saveDone(ok, message?)`: status stays "Saving..." until the host calls it; `true` gives "Saved", `false` gives the message. With no `save-request` listener at all the editor says "Saved" itself. `standalone.html` calls `saveDone(true)` after the download.
- A dragged corner never snaps to its two neighbours (an edge could collapse to zero length). If the pointer lands on one anyway, the corner stays where the pointer is.
- The selection clears when focus leaves the editor (unless it moved into the side panel), so a highlighted item always means Delete works. Panel buttons that remove something hand focus back to the editor so Ctrl+Z works.
- `build.mjs` copies `dist/editor.html` to `custom_components/floorplan_studio/www/` next to the JS bundles, so the integration serves the same single file. Playwright's globalSetup runs the build, so a test run rewrites `dist/` and `www/`.
- The v1 demo's garage contact catalog entry uses the v1 name `window`, so migration's catalog rename is exercised.

## 2026-09-19 Bound light and switch (assumption, maintainer request)

- One lamp can be two HA entities: a smart switch and a light helper on top of it. A `light` device may carry `bound`, the switch or plug entity id. `entity` (the light) stays the click target; the card toggles it and long press opens its more-info. The switch is reached from that dialog.
- `validate`: `bound` is an entity id, only on type light, differs from `entity`, unique across devices, and never another device's `entity`. Each problem is reported. `migrate` passes it through untouched.
- `renderFloor`: the icon is `on` if either entity is on, `unavailable` only if every present state is unavailable or unknown, else `off`. Class token `bound` is added. The title is `light: <name> + <bound friendly_name, else bound id>`; the renderer has no catalog, so it cannot look up a name otherwise.
- `core/bind.ts`: `placedEntities` and `unplacedCatalog`, so a bound pair leaves the Add, Device list together. The editor still has to use them.
- Demo: `light-living` is bound to `switch.demo_living_relay` (catalog id `switch-living-relay`). The v1 demo carries both. The render snapshot changed on that one device only.
- Editor: `unplaced()` uses `unplacedCatalog`. The Device panel of a light has "Controlled by" (`#vbound`): (none) plus unplaced switch and plug catalog entries that are no other device's `bound` and not the light's own entity; the current one always shows. It writes `bound` through `commit` (one undo step, none when unchanged; the key is deleted for none) and names the pair. Deleting a light drops `bound` with it, so the switch returns to Add. The editor has no device type field, so no type change can leave `bound` behind; `validate` would reject it.

## 2026-09-19 Add and remove stairs in the editor

- Add, Stairs places a 100 x 300 cm rectangle on the 5 cm grid, centred in the view, id `stairs-<floor>-<n>` from `newId`, name "Stairs", and selects it. `Sel` gains `{ t: "stairs", i }`; the panel has a name field and Delete. Delete and Backspace remove it (keys stay scoped to the editor). Undo restores index and id because history is whole-layout snapshots. Corners, add point and remove corner already worked for `s<i>` polygons. Core untouched.
- `playwright.config.ts` reads `PW_PORT` (default 5173; the stairs branch called it FP_PORT) so a second checkout does not reuse another checkout's dev server.

## 2026-09-19 Review fixes for the editor (S1.6, Opus review)

- Stairs are editable: the overlay draws their edges (`data-e="s<i>:<j>"`) and corner handles (`data-h`), and `hitOf` knows `data-s`. Openings and extras are drawn by the overlay (extra names escaped) so their end handles have a body. Core stays untouched.
- `room.label` is drawn under the room name by `renderFloor` (escaped). The demo has no labels, so the snapshot did not change.
- Keys are heard on the element, not on `window`. The element is focusable (`tabindex=0`) and takes focus on pointer down, so Delete and Ctrl+Z elsewhere in a page do nothing.
- `snapCorner` ranks loose ends and polygon corners in one list; the nearest wins.
- `EditorState.edit` returns false and records no undo step when the floor did not change; the element then fires no `layout-changed`.
- Save ends at "Saved" unless the host's `save-request` handler set its own status.
- `panel.ts` is renamed `panels.ts`: S3.2 owns `panel.ts`. The `floorplan-studio-panel.js` bundle keeps its name and now builds from `panels.ts` until S3.2.
- The demo catalog gained one unplaced contact sensor (`contact-garage`) so the door sensor picker has an option; the v1 demo carries it too.
- Add, Device groups by type only until S3.3 supplies areas to group by.

## 2026-09-19 Editor on the core (S1.6)

- The editor is a Lit element with shadow DOM. Hit-testing takes the real top element under the pointer (`g[data-x]` for a device icon, then handles, doors, furniture, edges, rooms). Where the top element is a room or the background, the nearest wall or edge within 8 px wins, so thin walls stay clickable without a wide overlay hiding icons.
- Edits are copy-on-write. A drag keeps the floor as it was at pointer down and recomputes the moved floor from it on every move; the undo step is recorded on the first real change. Shift is read on every move: with it, `movePointAll(..., detach, only)` moves just the grabbed corner.
- `ops.ts` (not in the S1.6 file list) holds the edits geometry.ts does not cover: loose wall, opening and extra ends. Core stays untouched.
- Loose ends (wall, opening, extra) are drawn as extra handles by the editor (`data-hp`), selected door ends as `data-dh`; `renderFloor` only draws polygon corners.
- The element never downloads or posts anything. File, Save validates, autosaves, and fires `save-request` (detail: the layout); the host writes it. `standalone.html` downloads `layout.json`; S3 will send it over the websocket.
- `seed` property (default: the first layout set) is what File, Reset returns to. `standalone.html` restores the autosave from `localStorage` (`floorplan-studio:layout`) before setting `layout`; a host in HA sets its own.
- Open and Reset validate first (`loadLayout`: migrate, then validate, never throws). A bad file shows the error list and leaves the layout as it was. Both keep undo history.
- `panel.ts` is now the selection panels, but `vite.config.ts` still builds it as the `floorplan-studio-panel.js` entry. S3 replaces that entry with the HA panel element; until then the bundle only carries the panel views.
- Grid snap for devices and furniture is a real 5 cm grid. The vanilla editor divided by 5 and multiplied by 5 without rounding, so it never snapped.
- `@types/node` is a dev dependency: the Playwright spec reads files and needs node typings for `tsc`.
- Playwright: `webServer` waits on `/standalone.html` because the dev root has no `index.html`.

## 2026-09-19 Review fixes for S1 (Opus review)

- `validate` never throws and checks every array field, the enums (room and door kind, device type, furniture symbol), finite numbers (north, coordinates) and door names. Layout files are untrusted input.
- `migrate` also normalises v2 files (missing arrays and ids, version "2"). Floors are stored without a prototype so a floor named `__proto__` stays a floor. The v1 renames (sensor, window) apply to v1 only.
- `render` escapes every interpolated string, including `kind` and `type`, and skips devices without finite coordinates. An unreadable `last_changed` counts as just changed.
- The heater bar carries `data-xbar`, not a second `data-x`, so `g[data-x]` is one element per device.
- The `.dev-motion.on` colour rule is gone. It beat the fade while a sensor was on.
- `@mdi/js` is a dev dependency: the icon paths are inlined in `icons.ts`, nothing imports the package at runtime.
- `websocket_api` stays in the manifest dependencies. The integration registers websocket commands (S3.1), which need it loaded first.
- Demo ground floor gained two furniture items so the renderer snapshot covers furniture. The v1 demo carries them too.

## 2026-09-19 Renderer choices (S1.4)

- Colours come from CSS classes and `--fp-*` variables. `FLOORPLAN_CSS` (exported from `render.ts`) holds the defaults; the host element overrides them. The markup has no literal colours.
- Motion fade is `1 - age/fade` from the state's `last_changed`, for any state that exists. The card (S2.4) passes the last `on` time as `last_changed` so a sensor that already went off keeps fading.
- Room glow is accepted in the options but drawn in S2.6.
- Icons are 24 px on screen at any zoom (`scale = 1 / opts.scale`), a 13 px backing circle keeps them readable on room fills.

## 2026-09-19 Geometry port (S1.3)

- `movePoints` takes an optional fifth argument `only: { poly, i }` naming the point to move when `detach` is true. Without it, detach moves the first match. A pure function cannot know which of several coincident points the user grabbed.
- `mergeCorners` ports the clustering and de-duplication of `simplify.py`. It does not pull corners onto edges or re-seat doors; the editor does that when a point is dropped (`stitch`).

## 2026-09-19 Untrusted JSON is typed `any` at the boundary

- ESLint `no-explicit-any` is off. `validate` and `migrate` read files nobody typed; they inspect them as `any` and return the typed `Layout`.
- `validate` requires every object to have an `id` (the spec says so) and reports all errors, not the first.

## 2026-09-19 Founding decisions

- Render the layout natively in a custom card. No picture-elements export: it cannot do motion fade, door geometry highlights or per-type behaviour without YAML per element.
- Popups are HA's more-info dialogs. Custom dialogs only for confirmed actions (open a door).
- Two repos. This one is public with a demo layout. The maintainer's house stays in a private repo that consumes this library.
- Stack: TypeScript and Lit for editor and card, core in TypeScript without a framework, Vite build, Vitest tests. Vanilla was considered and rejected: a card and a panel by hand means manual re-render on every `hass` update and no types on a growing schema.
- A small integration ships with the package for load and save over websocket, so the editor and card share one stored layout. File drop into `www/` remains a fallback.
- Name `ha-floorplan-studio`, licence MIT. `ha-floorplan` is taken by another project.
- Icons: Material Design Icons (Apache 2.0), the set HA uses, inlined as paths.
- A prompt for LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) produces the first layout from photos. It lives in `prompts/` and the README explains the steps.
