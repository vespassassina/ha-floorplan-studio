# Decisions

Newest first. A change supersedes; nothing is edited.

## 2026-09-19 Review fixes for S1 (Opus review)

- `validate` never throws and checks every array field, the enums (room and door kind, device type, furniture symbol), finite numbers (north, coordinates) and door names. Layout files are untrusted input.
- `migrate` also normalises v2 files (missing arrays and ids, version "2"). Floors are stored without a prototype so a floor named `__proto__` stays a floor. The v1 renames (sensor, window) apply to v1 only.
- `render` escapes every interpolated string, including `kind` and `type`, and skips devices without finite coordinates. An unreadable `last_changed` counts as just changed.
- The heater bar carries `data-xbar`, not a second `data-x`, so `g[data-x]` is one element per device.
- The `.dev-motion.on` colour rule is gone. It beat the fade while a sensor was on.
- `@mdi/js` is a dev dependency: the icon paths are inlined in `icons.ts`, nothing imports the package at runtime.
- `websocket_api` stays in the manifest dependencies. The integration registers websocket commands (S3.1), which need it loaded first.
- Demo ground floor gained two furniture items so the renderer snapshot covers furniture. The v1 demo carries them too.

## 2026-09-19 Renderer choices (S1.4)

- Colours come from CSS classes and `--fp-*` variables. `FLOORPLAN_CSS` (exported from `render.ts`) holds the defaults; the host element overrides them. The markup has no literal colours.
- Motion fade is `1 - age/fade` from the state's `last_changed`, for any state that exists. The card (S2.4) passes the last `on` time as `last_changed` so a sensor that already went off keeps fading.
- Room glow is accepted in the options but drawn in S2.6.
- Icons are 24 px on screen at any zoom (`scale = 1 / opts.scale`), a 13 px backing circle keeps them readable on room fills.

## 2026-09-19 Geometry port (S1.3)

- `movePoints` takes an optional fifth argument `only: { poly, i }` naming the point to move when `detach` is true. Without it, detach moves the first match. A pure function cannot know which of several coincident points the user grabbed.
- `mergeCorners` ports the clustering and de-duplication of `simplify.py`. It does not pull corners onto edges or re-seat doors; the editor does that when a point is dropped (`stitch`).

## 2026-09-19 Untrusted JSON is typed `any` at the boundary

- ESLint `no-explicit-any` is off. `validate` and `migrate` read files nobody typed; they inspect them as `any` and return the typed `Layout`.
- `validate` requires every object to have an `id` (the spec says so) and reports all errors, not the first.

## 2026-09-19 Founding decisions

- Render the layout natively in a custom card. No picture-elements export: it cannot do motion fade, door geometry highlights or per-type behaviour without YAML per element.
- Popups are HA's more-info dialogs. Custom dialogs only for confirmed actions (open a door).
- Two repos. This one is public with a demo layout. The maintainer's house stays in a private repo that consumes this library.
- Stack: TypeScript and Lit for editor and card, core in TypeScript without a framework, Vite build, Vitest tests. Vanilla was considered and rejected: a card and a panel by hand means manual re-render on every `hass` update and no types on a growing schema.
- A small integration ships with the package for load and save over websocket, so the editor and card share one stored layout. File drop into `www/` remains a fallback.
- Name `ha-floorplan-studio`, licence MIT. `ha-floorplan` is taken by another project.
- Icons: Material Design Icons (Apache 2.0), the set HA uses, inlined as paths.
- A prompt for LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) produces the first layout from photos. It lives in `prompts/` and the README explains the steps.
