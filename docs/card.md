# The card

`custom:floorplan-studio-card` draws one floor of your plan as a live Lovelace
card: rooms, walls, stairs, furniture and every device you attached to a Home
Assistant entity, in one glance, at scale.

## Adding it to a dashboard

Nothing to install by hand — the integration serves the card's script to every
dashboard. Add the card by its type:

```yaml
type: custom:floorplan-studio-card
```

With no other keys it draws your plan's first floor, in the `blueprint` theme,
motion fading over 300 seconds, `room_glow` off.

The editor itself can write this for you: File, Install code opens a panel
with a whole dashboard, matching your plan as it currently stands — theme,
floors — ready to paste. See "A premade dashboard" below.

## Config keys

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `floor` | the first floor in the layout | which floor to draw, by its id (`ground`, `first`, ...); `all` shows a floor switcher in the card itself |
| `floors` | unset | an array of floor ids: shows a switcher over only these floors, in this order, defaulting to the first one. Takes precedence over `floor`. An id the layout doesn't have is dropped; if none of them match, this is the same as leaving `floors` unset |
| `theme` | `blueprint` | `blueprint`, `light`, `midnight`, `slate`, `terminal`, `solarized`, or `ha` (see Themes, below) |
| `fade` | `300` | seconds a motion sensor takes to fade from red to grey after it last went off |
| `room_glow` | `false` | tint a room's fill when any light inside it is on |

```yaml
type: custom:floorplan-studio-card
floors:
  - ground
  - first
fade: 300
room_glow: true
theme: blueprint
```

## A premade dashboard

To get a whole dashboard rather than one card: in the editor, File, Install
code. It shows a dashboard — one view, this card, your plan's current theme
and floors — ready to paste as-is:

```yaml
title: Floorplan
views:
  - title: Floorplan
    path: floorplan
    cards:
      - type: custom:floorplan-studio-card
        theme: blueprint
        floors:
          - ground
          - first
```

Settings, Dashboards, Add dashboard, New dashboard from scratch, then its ⋮
menu, Edit in YAML, and paste this over what's there. To add the card to a
dashboard you already have instead, paste only the `cards:` entry into an
existing view.

## Themes

Seven themes, chosen with `theme:` — never by your dashboard's own light/dark
mode, which the card ignores.

- **`blueprint`** (default) — dark blue ground, cool white linework, a
  terminal-green measurement grid, one saturated orange for anything "on".
- **`light`** — the paper-and-ink set: light ground, dark ink.
- **`midnight`** — the project's original dark theme, kept under its own name.
- **`slate`** — light neutral grey, dark ink, burnt-orange accent.
- **`terminal`** — near-black, terminal green throughout, amber accent.
- **`solarized`** — the real Solarized dark palette; unlike the others, each
  device type keeps its own Solarized hue instead of collapsing to one accent.
- **`ha`** — inherits your dashboard's own theme variables (background, text,
  secondary background for rooms) instead of a fixed palette. Falls back to
  `light` or `midnight` (by `hass.themes.darkMode`) for anything your
  dashboard's theme doesn't define.

## What a device looks like, on and off

Every device sits on a white disc, above rooms and their names. An idle
device is grey; an active one takes its type's own colour — one
`--fp-dev-<type>` accent per type. A handful of types behave a little
differently:

- **Light** — grey when off; on, it turns amber (or the bulb's own colour, if
  it reports one) and grows a soft aura on the plan. Tap toggles it; a long
  press opens Home Assistant's more-info dialog.
- **Light with a bound switch** — one icon that lights up if either the light
  or its switch is on. Tap always toggles the light itself.
- **Motion sensor** — red the moment it triggers, fading back to grey over
  `fade` seconds from when it last went off — even if it's already off by the
  time the card loads.
- **Camera** — a dark cone of view, turned to match the device's own
  rotation.
- **Radar (mmWave presence)** — a purple icon while its presence entity is on,
  plus one small dot per tracked target, turned by the device's own `rot` (0
  is "ahead is screen-up"). Point `entity` at the presence binary sensor, and
  each `targets` pair at that target's own x/y sensors — an ESPHome LD2450
  gives one x/y pair per target it can track, named by its own YAML:

  ```yaml
  # ESPHome, an LD2450 on a UART: exposes an occupancy binary sensor and, per target
  # (1 to 3, one block each), the x/y sensors floorplan-studio's device.targets wants.
  binary_sensor:
    - platform: ld2450
      target_count:
        name: "Office radar occupancy"
        id: office_radar_occupancy

  sensor:
    - platform: ld2450
      target_1:
        x:
          name: "Office radar target 1 x"
          id: office_radar_t1_x
        y:
          name: "Office radar target 1 y"
          id: office_radar_t1_y
  ```

  In the device panel, `entity` is `binary_sensor.office_radar_occupancy`, and
  the first `targets` pair is `sensor.office_radar_target_1_x` /
  `sensor.office_radar_target_1_y` (Home Assistant's own generated entity ids
  for the `name`s above — repeat the `target_2`/`target_3` blocks and add a
  pair each for more than one tracked person).
- **Cover on a door** — an open door draws orange; tapping it asks before
  opening or closing.
- **Unavailable or unknown** — dims to 45% opacity, in any state, with no
  strikethrough: Home Assistant's own dashboards dim rather than cross out,
  and a struck-through icon this small reads as noise, not signal.

The full type-by-type table — idle look, active look, exact colour token,
what a tap does — is in [`SPEC.md`, "Card behaviours"](SPEC.md#card-behaviours).

## Furniture and rooms

A piece of furniture with no entity is a plain grey silhouette — decoration.
One with an entity takes the same amber "on" accent as a device when its
entity is on, open or playing.

A custom room (no Home Assistant area, drawn free-hand) can carry its own
`entity` too: its outline lights up while that entity is on, open or playing,
its fill never moves. A room linked to an *area* instead reflects every
device placed inside it — that's what `room_glow` tints.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing draws.** Check the integration is installed and a layout has been
  saved from the editor at least once (File → Save inside Home Assistant, not
  the standalone download).
- **A device stays grey.** Confirm its entity id in the editor's device panel
  — an empty or unknown entity id always reads as unavailable.
- **The theme looks wrong on `ha`.** Your dashboard's own theme may not
  define every variable the card reads; it falls back to `light`/`midnight`
  per variable, so a partial theme can look mixed. Pick a fixed theme instead
  if that bothers you.
